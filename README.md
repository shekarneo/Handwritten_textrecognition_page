## Train model 

### IAM dataset

The data-loader expects the IAM dataset \[5\] (or any other dataset that is compatible with it) in the `data/` directory.
Follow these instructions to get the dataset:

1. Register for free at this [website](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database).
2. Download `words/words.tgz`.
3. Download `ascii/words.txt`.
4. Put `words.txt` into the `data/` directory.
5. Create the directory `data/words/`.
6. Put the content (directories `a01`, `a02`, ...) of `words.tgz` into `data/words/`.
7. Go to `data/` and run `python checkDirs.py` for a rough check if everything is ok.

If you want to train the model from scratch, delete the files contained in the `model/` directory.
Otherwise, the parameters are loaded from the last model-snapshot before training begins.
Then, go to the `src/` directory and execute `python main.py --train`.
After each epoch of training, validation is done on a validation set (the dataset is split into 95% of the samples used for training and 5% for validation as defined in the class `DataLoader`).
If you only want to do validation given a trained NN, execute `python main.py --validate`.
